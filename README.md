# Predict-the-Direction-of-a-Screenshot
Overview
In this challenge, your task is to predict the orientation of computer screenshots taken from various video games. These screenshots may appear in any of four rotations: 0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째. Your AI model must analyze each image and correctly classify its rotation direction.

The screenshots may contain in-game HUDs, menus, or gameplay scenes. So your model must learn to detect subtle visual cues and structural hints to infer the correct orientation.

Games used in the test data are different from those in the training data.
